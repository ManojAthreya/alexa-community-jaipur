## Stack Used: MERN.
The website stands on the MERN architecture. You can find the front-end part within the *client* folder.

## Further Development and Contribution
The website requires a whole new fresher look. We would love to see your *creativity and bring out the designer within you.* You can spill your ideas using the Material UI library for React. We need designer who could create *wireframes* for the website. 

## Steps to get you started:
Before moving forward, make sure you are aware of the MERN stack and have the necessary libraries and packages installed. React is built using the create-react-app package for your knowledge. Follow these steps to run the website locally.  

- Clone the repo using terminal, giving this command ```git clone https://github.com/alexa-dev-hub/alexa-community-jaipur.git```.
- Then type ```cd alexa-community-jaipur```.
- Now if you have nodemon installed then type ```npm run dev``` to start the development backend server.
- You will see the server starts at your localhost, port 5000.  
- Now open another terminal and browse to the same folder.
- Now type ```cd client``` to move into the client folder (React).
- We will run the backend and frontend separately.
- Then type ```npm run start``` to begin the React local server.
- Goto ```http://localhost:3000```, to see the website up and running.
- You may have to change the the API Url to direct at the backend local port.
- Explanation on client-side is in this [README](https://github.com/alexa-dev-hub/alexa-community-jaipur/blob/master/client/README.md)

## Good for?
